# Norbit homework

### A basic application which streams boat position data to a node.js server which then sends it to the frontend "live". The react frontend shows the position of the boat real-time, with the possibility of recording the route and disabling the stream, and with the possibility of visualizing saved routes. The saved coordinates are stored in psql database. The original boat position data is stored in csv format.

### Technologies:
Backend: node.js, socket.io, express, psql

Frontend: react, socket.io, openLayers

### Setup:

- install dependencies for both the frontend and the backend using separate package.json files
- run "node express"  for the server
- run "node mock_app" for the mock application which streams boat position data
- run "npm start" inside the frontend_client folder for running the frontend

### Known bugs / future tasks:

- No multiple recording sessions simultaneously
- Newly connected clients can stop the recording in progress
- Newly connected clients can stop the stream for all clients

- Add the ability to zoom when streaming data
- User registration for managing saved sessions
- Possibility to delete unwanted tracks
- User friendly design for track list and for the buttons
